3.  _Terms Specific to Domain Name Services._

    1.  We resell domain names. When you apply to register a domain name, your request is transmitted to  [eNom](https://www.enom.com) (www.eNom.com).  By using our Domain Name Services, you agree to be bound by eNom’s domain name registration policies and procedures, so please read them. These policies and procedures are available at: www.eNom.com/terms.  Because of the mechanics of domain name registration, we cannot guarantee that your domain name will be registered.  After registration, it is your responsibility to ensure your domain name does not lapse and is timely renewed and we are not responsible for any lapse or any damages caused by any lapse.  We will make commercially reasonable efforts to renew any domain names that are set to auto-renew.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, ANY SUCH RENEWAL IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AND WE SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR THE FAILURE OF ANY SUCH RENEWAL OR AUTO RENEWAL, ANY RELATED DOMAIN EXPIRATION OR THE REGISTRATION OF ANY EXPIRED DOMAIN BY A THIRD-PARTY.
    2.  It is your sole responsibility to fully investigate and ensure that the domain name you register does not infringe on the legal or intellectual property rights of others. We do not check to see whether a domain name you register or use infringes on the rights of any third party and we suggest you seek advice of legal counsel before registering any domain.
    3.  A2 Hosting will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with any legal order to cancel, modify, or transfer your domain name.  [ICANN's Transfer Policy](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en) requires a 60 day transfer lock to apply to your domain name(s) in the event of any “Change of Registrant.” A2 Hosting currently locks your domain name for any change involving your WhoIs information. This feature is designed to protect your domain from any unauthorized attempt to transfer your domain. We do not offer an option to opt out of the 60 day transfer lock. Any “Change of Registrant” as defined by  [ICANN's Transfer Policy](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en) will subject the domain to a 60 days transfer lock. Please note that the parameters that trigger the 60 day transfer lock are subject to change. The current parameters which trigger the 60 day lock include: (A) change of registrant First Name, (B) change of registrant Last Name, (C) change of registrant Organization Name, (D) change of registrant Email.  You also agree and understand ICANN’s policies for Domain Verification and any other current or future policies they might enact.  More information can be found here:  [https://www.enom.com/reseller/legal-policy-agreements/registrant-benefits-and-responsibilities/](https://www.enom.com/reseller/legal-policy-agreements/registrant-benefits-and-responsibilities/), [https://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/educational](https://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/educational), and [https://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/benefits](https://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/benefits)

4.  _Terms That Apply to All Hosting Services._

    1.  Our Hosting accounts are allocated bandwidth depending on the package you select.  The bandwidth for Services purchased does not rollover and is not creditable across periods.  In the event you require more bandwidth than you have purchased, your account may be suspended until the next period, you may purchase additional bandwidth by upgrading your account, your account may be terminated for a violation of the terms of the package you purchased, or we may charge you an additional fee for the overage, in our sole discretion.
    2.  We will provide, as part of the Service cost, the number of primary IP addresses included in the plan you select.  You may request additional IP addresses for an additional fee.  If we need to change one of your assigned IP addresses we will notify you of the change by email. You may use the IP addresses provided only in association with the Services and they may not be transferred.
    3.  In using our hosting Services, you may not place excessive burdens on our CPUs, servers, or other resources, including our customer support services. You understand that bandwidth, connection speeds, and other similar indices of capacity are maximum numbers. Consistently reaching these capacity numbers may result in our need to place restrictions on your use of the Services, including suspension or termination of your account or a reduction in bandwidth available for your use (also known as bandwidth throttling), in our sole discretion. You agree that we may place restrictions on your use of the Services or customer support services to the extent that they exceed the use of these resources by similarly situated customers.

If you utilize Managed or Unmanaged Hosting Service with Root Access, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any changes you make while using such access and A2 Hosting may not be able to correct any changes, recover data, or reverse any damage you do when using Root Access capabilities. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to troubleshoot issues upon request, as stated in our Support Policy, located at: [https://www.a2hosting.com/policies/#Support-Policy](https://www.a2hosting.com/policies/#Support-Policy).
    3.  Cloud VPS Hosting accounts are billed by usage and charges will accrue over the billing period based on the resources used. The initial purchase payment is put on your account as a credit that is then applied to your next invoice(s).  Since configurations can be changed at any time, your invoice will always show an itemized breakdown of the resources used.  Additional details can be found in our Billing & Refund Policy.

    7.  For Shared Web Hosting and Reseller Hosting, the terms “unlimited” and “unmetered” are defined by our experience with similarly situated customers. This means that your use of our resources may not exceed that of similarly situated customers.

    8.  For our cPanel Shared Web Hosting and cPanel Reseller Hosting Services, our complimentary JetBackup will provide complimentary backups of your data.  These backups will be done using our commercially reasonable efforts and may not include all files, including some email files, due to technical constraints.  A2 Cloud Backup powered by JetBackup are limited to an aggregate 50GB quota.

We may also delete mail in your spam or bulk mail folder after such email becomes more than thirty (30) days old in order to help manage storage limits.  Notwithstanding any automatic complimentary backup services, you should backup and save your emails locally to ensure they will be available when needed. If an email is deleted, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to retrieve such email but cannot guarantee recovery of any emails.  Email accounts may be subject to storage quotas specified in a particular package.

    11. Our Email Hosting Services do not ensure that your inbound and outbound emails will be delivered; settings beyond our control may impact email deliverability, including emails being sent to a spam folder or emails not being delivered at all.  IP address blacklisting beyond our control may also affect email delivery.
